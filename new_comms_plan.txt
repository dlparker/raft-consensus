Change CommsAPI to have a get_message async call, change server to call it as a task.
Change COMMS init to happen in app init instead of server create.
Change bank teller app to accept a comms in init
Change dev_tools/bt_server.py to init comms and pass to app init.
Change app:
   1. Make our own log mechanism for account records
   2. Add client comms call to do account op, make an API from commsAPI and get dev_tools version to implement
   3. Call leader function to start a logged change, include our account log record id in raft log record
   4. Leader returns an appendEntry message, app sends it along with actual log record in app specific message
   5. App waits for leader to return status of appendEntry sequence
   6. Accept follower function call to persist appendEntry data
   7. App (leader) gets append entry result from raft leader code
   8. Respond to client with result
      a. new record report if good (raft log has a commit mark now, so you don't need an app specific one)
      b. new leader id if leadership changed
      c. error otherwise
