=================
Clarity plan

1. Clean up server creation mess
   1. NOT!!! Start using ModulesConfig in server_config.py
   2. Build a default config example that uses production parts such as UDP comms and SQLite log
   3. Build a default config example that uses development parts such as Memory comms
   4. Build an echo app to use for the above examples
Done:   5. Generalize Working dir in LiveConfig to LocalConfig

DONE: 2. Move Banking Teller App to dev_tools, consider dev_tools and tests to sibling of raft, so
   it will be easier to distribute production bits as library
