Review and document new message times and ensure that they
actually improve things compared to the more limited set defined
in the raft paper. Do a side by side sequence diagram to identify
where my messages take the place of appendentries messages with
specific values and follower states.

Add log trimming sequence.

Add paging to log pull protocol

examine all abstract base classes to make sure they have the
correct __subclasshook__ method logic

add a setup step for comms api to install serializer class instead
of hard coding to original


clean up log api around storing pending response to client, the whole
context thing is a fudge, we should be more agressive about log
data format, probably adding context there.


Build something to collect and clear unhandled errors in server.py,
including a logging mechanism that is robust against errors, so
the errors go in an in-memory log and then into a disk log such
that the second call will not kill the process or result in a loop.
Maybe an "ErrorSink" class?

Find all the state locations that can produce an unrecoverable
error and have them report the error to the state machine, which
will report it to the server, which will save it in unrecoverable.

Build an unrecoverable error mechanism that calls app.restart to
see if the server should die, restart, or whatever. Maybe a callback
in the base server? (Maybe need to rename "Server" class to something
like ServerCore?) Find all bad spots in the states and change the
exception clauses to call this method, execute stop on self and return.
